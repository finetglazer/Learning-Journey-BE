## ⚠️ Important Demo Instructions

To ensure a smooth testing experience, please follow these guidelines regarding authentication.

### 1. Do NOT use "Sign in with Google" (OAuth2)

* **Status:** Disabled for this Demo Environment.
* **Reason:** Google's strict OAuth 2.0 security policies do not allow production redirects to raw IP addresses or dynamic DNS services (like `nip.io`). A purchased Top-Level Domain (TLD) with SSL (HTTPS) is required for this feature to function in a live environment.

### 2. Do NOT use "Sign Up" (Create New Account)

* **Status:** Disabled for this Demo Environment.
* **Reason:** The system requires email verification to activate new accounts. Currently, the Cloud Provider (DigitalOcean) blocks outbound SMTP traffic (Ports 587/465) on new instances to prevent spam. Therefore, verification emails cannot be delivered to new users at this time.
